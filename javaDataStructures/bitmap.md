### Bitmap in Java

A **Bitmap** is a data structure that efficiently represents a set of boolean values or integers using bits. It is commonly used for tasks like:

- Representing large sets of data in a memory-efficient way.
- Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Checking membership of elements in constant time.

#### Key Features of a Bitmap:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Each bit represents a single value, making it highly space-efficient.
2. **Fast Operations**: Operations like setting, clearing, and checking bits are performed in constant time.
3. **Compact Representation**: Useful for representing large datasets with minimal memory usage.

#### Use Cases of Bitmap:

- Representing flags or boolean states.
- Tracking visited nodes in graph algorithms.
- Deduplication of integers in a range.
- Implementing Bloom Filters.

#### Implementing a Bitmap in Java:

Java does not have a built-in `Bitmap` class, but you can use the `BitSet` class from the `java.util` package to implement bitmap functionality.

#### Example: Using `BitSet` in Java

```java
import java.util.BitSet;

public class BitmapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a BitSet of size 10
        BitSet bitSet = new BitSet(10);

        // Set bits at specific positions
        bitSet.set(2);
        bitSet.set(4);
        bitSet.set(7);

        // Check if a bit is set
        System.out.println("Is bit 2 set? " + bitSet.get(2)); // Outputs: true
        System.out.println("Is bit 5 set? " + bitSet.get(5)); // Outputs: false

        // Clear a bit
        bitSet.clear(4);

        // Print the BitSet
        System.out.println("BitSet: " + bitSet); // Outputs: {2, 7}

        // Perform logical operations
        BitSet anotherSet = new BitSet(10);
        anotherSet.set(7);
        anotherSet.set(8);

        bitSet.and(anotherSet); // Intersection
        System.out.println("After AND operation: " + bitSet); // Outputs: {7}
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Creating a BitSet**: The `BitSet` class is initialized with a size, though it can grow dynamically.
2. **Setting Bits**: Use the `set(index)` method to set a bit at a specific position.
3. **Checking Bits**: Use the `get(index)` method to check if a bit is set.
4. **Clearing Bits**: Use the `clear(index)` method to reset a bit to `false`.
5. **Logical Operations**: Perform operations like `and`, `or`, and `xor` between two `BitSet` objects.

#### Advantages of Bitmap:

- Compact and efficient representation of data.
- Fast membership checks and updates.
- Ideal for scenarios with a large range of integers.

#### Limitations of Bitmap:

- Fixed range: Bitmaps are efficient only when the range of possible values is known and not sparse.
- Not suitable for storing non-integer or non-boolean data.

#### Alternatives:

For more complex use cases, consider using data structures like `HashSet` or `BloomFilter`.
